### OVERVIEW

There are two fields for the testimonial text: one for a 25-30 word summary
that will be displayed in a block, one for full text that will be displayed
on the testimonials page. You may also include the client name, company and
URL. The date field is used for your own reference - it is not published.

* PHP 5.3.3 and higher.

### INSTALLATION

### UPGRADING

Once you have uploaded the latest Tag Plugin through the glFusion Plugin Administration screen and selected upgrade, you will need to do the following:

2. Select **Rescan Content**. This will rescan all glFusion content and rebuild the tag mappings.
